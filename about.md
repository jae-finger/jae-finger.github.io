🙋‍♂️ About Jon

🧙‍♂️ Hello, netizen! I'm your residential data alchemist, feasting on transformers, LLMs, and a platter of NLP with my gluten-free morning munch. Take that, wheat!

🎓🐛 Formerly a biology grad on a crusade, I tracked invasive species gallivanting across the U.S quicker with their mind on wrecking native river systems. Presented my research on four continents - Antarctica, I'm still waiting on that invite... 🐧

✈️ Hailing from the expansive Chicagoland, I spent a decade in Washington State's lush greenery... Traded real bugs for the digital ones, and Chicago's skyline for the Space Needle. And yes, found gluten-free deep-dish and salmon sushi! 🍕🍣

🏖️👩‍💻🐩 When I'm not data-wrestling, I'm beach strolling along Lake Michigan with my syntax-savvy girlfriend and Augie, our pocket-sized poodle with more 'Fetch' requests than a busy server.

☕ As for my veins, they're 90% caffeine and 10% audacity. If coffee was a programming language, I'd be a CoffeeScript savant. And you bet it's always with a side of gluten-free biscotti.
