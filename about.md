🙋‍♂️ About Jon

🧙‍♂️ Greetings! I'm a data sorcerer 📊✨ who specializes in the mystical realms of NLP, LLMS, and the enchanting world of generative AI. 🌟

🎓🐛 In a past life, I roamed the wilds as a biologist, tirelessly tracking invasive species across the vast landscapes of the U.S., protecting native river systems from their nefarious grasp. 🌿🌊

Now, my days are spent conjuring insights and crafting actionable solutions for my clients, while I embark on epic quests to create accessible AI projects of my own. 🚀✨ Armed with the tools of science, I wield the power to unravel mysteries and provide swift solutions to an array of challenges. 🧬🔮

When I'm not deciphering data, you'll find me in the digital realms of video games, exploring new horizons with my girlfriend 🌍✈️, and training my faithful canine companion, Augie. 🐶🏋️ We also share our apartment with two chirpy parakeets 🦜🦜 and a rather dapper pigeon 🕊️.
