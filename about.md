🧙‍♂️ About Jon

Located in Chicago 🌆, Jon is a normal human data scientist with a graduate background in biology 🧬. Now, his specialty lies data science. Specifically... machine learning, natural language processing, and ML ops by way of python🐍, sql, docker, and whatever else he can get his hands on.

When not generating insight, his time is spent enjoying nature & wildlife with his long-term partner, Allie 🥰; unwinding via gaming 🎮; and caring for his loyal dog 🐶 and three loud-mouthed birds 🦜🦜🕊️. Jon also enjoys volunteering at the Save the Birds! rescue outside the city, where he co-manages the website with his partner 😎.
