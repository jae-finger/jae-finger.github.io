# Changes Beginning

As the sun sets on our latest life chapter in Chicago, we're gearing up for some major life changes ⚠️. We've been here for a couple years now helping family, but it's time to move on.

I find myself filled with gratitude 🙏 for the freedom that my career in tech and data science has afforded me. It's a stark contrast to my previous life in academia, where I felt tethered and restricted. Now, I'm not chained to a random city in the middle of Idaho, but rather, I have the liberty to move around relatively freely.

Next stop: California 🗻🏜️.  The freedom and ability to make this move is not just a logistical win, but a massive boost for my mental health 🧘‍♂️. 

Looking back, it's almost surreal to think about how close I was to a completely different life. A life where this kind of freedom and flexibility was merely a dream. I never knew this life & path was possible, and I consider myself incredibly lucky to have found this escape route when I did 🍀.

So, here's to the next chapter, the next adventure, and the endless possibilities that await us. California, here we come! 🛻💨
